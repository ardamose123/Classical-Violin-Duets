Classical violin duets
======================

Lilypond typesets of violin duets scans taken from IMSLP.

This project will host, in the short term, Bach's Double Concerto and John Walsh's ["A Choice Collection of Aires and Duets"](http://imslp.org/wiki/Airs_and_Duets_for_2_Flutes_(Walsh,_John\)). Later, more pieces will be added.
